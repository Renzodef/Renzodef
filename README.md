My name is Vitoronzo De Francesco, but everybody call me Renzo.
I work as Junior Developer (in the Graduate Development Program) for DxC technology in Bari, south Italy.
I'm currently finishing my Master's Degree in Computer Science Engineering and my Diploma in Piano, always in Bari.
I'm particularly interested in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.
